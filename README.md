## Features Implemented

### User Authentication and Security
- **Sign Up/Login System**: Secure sign-up and login using hashed passwords, data validation and JWT tokens.
- **Password Security**: Strong password requirements enforced, and extra security measures for password updates.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: MFA is implemented during login through a one-time passcode (with a time limit) sent via email, adding an extra layer of security.

### Financial Transactions Management
- **Financial Transactions Table**: Stores information about user transactions, including deposits, income, expenses, and investments. This table allows users to track their financial activities in detail.
- **Data Integration**: Transactions are integrated into the application, enabling the frontend to present income, expenses, and investments, and provide insights through visualizations.

### Email Notifications
- **Account Updates**: Notifies users of important account updates, such as password changes or new logins from unfamiliar devices.

## Deployed Server
- **Backend Server hosted on Render**: [https://fintrack-backend-services.onrender.com/](https://fintrack-backend-services.onrender.com/)

## GitHub Repositories
- **Frontend**: [https://github.com/jorammercado/fin-track-frontend](https://github.com/jorammercado/fin-track-frontend)
- **Backend**: [https://github.com/jorammercado/fin-track-backend](https://github.com/jorammercado/fin-track-backend)

## Installation

1. Fork the repository from [https://github.com/jorammercado/fin-track-backend](https://github.com/jorammercado/fin-track-backend).

2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fin-track-backend.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd fin-track-backend
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory with the following content:
   ```
   PORT=4001
   PG_HOST=localhost
   PG_PORT=5432
   PG_DATABASE=fintrack_dev
   PG_USER=postgres
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
   ```
   
   > To generate the `JWT_SECRET`, run the following command:
   > ```bash
   > node generateJWTSecret.js
   > ```
   > This script will create and write a secure JWT secret to your `.env` file. If unsuccessful, manually add a strong secret string.
   >
   > For `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS`, use credentials from an email account configured to allow third-party access (e.g., enable "less secure app access" or use an app password).

5. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

6. Ensure PostgreSQL is running locally.

7. Run the SQL scripts to set up the database schema and seed data:
   ```bash
   npm run db_schema
   npm run db_seed
   ```

8. To start the backend server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
   or for automatic server restart on file changes:
   ```bash
   nodemon server.js
   ```

This will run the backend services locally on the specified port.

## Next Steps
Once the backend is running, you can connect it to the frontend application and begin development or testing.

## Testing 
Unit tests are implemented using Jest. To run tests:
```bash
npm test
```
